# Measuring Income Inequality in Pakistan: Constructing Distributional National Accounts

It is a well-known problem in economics that survey data is wildly inaccurate for estimating top incomes. As a result, it is exceedingly difficult to derive a country's income distribution from surveys alone. To do so, we must draw on other data sources like taxes, wealth lists and national accounts data.

We combine newly released tax records with survey data to produce estimates for the income distribution of Pakistan. The goal is to divide the aggregate 'national income' statistic derived from national accounts data into strata that represent the full distribution of earners in Pakistan (hence the term distributional national accounts). The following is the main table of our results:

We provide a walkthrough of how we achieved these results in the below files. The original notebooks are above, feel free to send a pull request if you have alternative scenarios or assumptions in mind.
